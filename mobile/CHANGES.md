# Daily Grocer Mobile — Change Log

Running log of production-readiness changes. Spec: `.claude/memory/daily-grocer-mobile-brief.md`.
Each entry maps to a single-concern commit; `flutter analyze` is clean before each.

## Phase 1 — Screen & flow parity

### Build infra — track mobile in monorepo + android/ios scaffold
- Removed `/mobile` from the repo root `.gitignore`. The entire Flutter app was previously
  untracked/ignored; it is now version-controlled in the monorepo so CI can build it.
- Generated `android/` and `ios/` via `flutter create . --platforms=android,ios --org uk.co.dailygrocer`
  so a clean checkout builds. Removed the out-of-scope `web/` and `windows/` scaffolds
  (target is App Store / Play Store only).
- Baseline `flutter analyze`: 0 errors / 0 warnings (9 pre-existing `info` lints in untouched files).
